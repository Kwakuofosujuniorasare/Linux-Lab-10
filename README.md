# Overview

This Python project implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It involves shifting each letter by a number of places in the alphabet. This educational project is aimed at helping users familiarize themselves with basic cryptography and command line operations, particularly using Python without an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Purpose

The primary goal of this program is to demonstrate:

The application of basic encryption and decryption techniques.
The utility of Python for direct execution via the command line.
Handling of ASCII character transformations in a programming context.
Features

Accepts a numerical key for the cipher as a command line argument.
Reads input directly from the command line or a file.
Converts input text to uppercase and encrypts it by shifting letters based on the provided key.
Outputs encrypted text in formatted blocks for readability.
